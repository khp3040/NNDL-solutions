# NNDL-solutions

> Solutions (math and code) of the exercises and problems from Michael Nielsen's book [*Neural Networks And Deep Learning*](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) (and adaptations to the code for Python 3 and Theano 1.0.3).

Here's where to find the solutions to exercises and problems:
* involving math:  `notebooks`
* involving code: implemented in `code`, discussed in `notebooks`

With links to nbviewer:

## TODO

So far, I've provided solutions to all exercises and problems, except:

* chap3 p8, p9
* chap4 p1 (b) and (c)
* chap6 p5, p7 (theano part)
