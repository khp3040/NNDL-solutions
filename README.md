# NNDL-solutions

> Solutions (math and code) of the exercises and problems from Michael Nielsen's online book *Neural Networks And Deep Learning* (and also adaptations to the code for Python 3).

The solutions can be found in the directory ```notebooks``` (nbviewer currently recommended because of the issues Github has with rendering math in notebooks: [notebooks on nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/nndl-solutions/NNDL-solutions/tree/master/notebooks/)).

This work is in progress: I'm regularly updating this repo with my solutions, which takes some time since I hadn't written them neatly enough when I first did the exercises.

Here are the uploaded chapters so far (again, providing links to nbviewer):
