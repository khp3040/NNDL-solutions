# NNDL-solutions

> Solutions (math and code) of the exercises and problems from Michael Nielsen's online book *Neural Networks And Deep Learning* (and also adaptations to the code for Python 3).

This work is in progress: I'm regularly updating this repo with my solutions, which takes some time since I hadn't written them neatly enough when I first did the exercises.

The solutions can be found in the directory [notebooks](notebooks), in the form of Jupyter notebooks.

Here are the uploaded chapters so far:

* [Chapter 0:Â Update the code for Python 3](notebooks/chap-0-update-code-for-python3.ipynb)
* [Chapter 1: Using neural nets to recognize handwritten digits](notebooks/chap-1-using-neural-nets-to-recognize-handwritten-digits.ipynb)
